# Transcriptomic

Here, I analyzed  expression profiling by high throughput sequencing in accession number GSE121884. 

Above is presented transcriptional analysis of the pancreatic islets of adult Paupar KO mice versus Paupar WT mice.
Aligned reads were assigned to genes using annotations from Ensembl (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.73.gtf) and HTseq-count v0.10.0 (Anders et al., 2015). Differential expression across cohorts was assessed using DESeq2 v1.18 (Love, Huber, and Anders, 2014). Among the downregulated genes with a p-value < 0.05 genes important for alpha cell identity and function.
